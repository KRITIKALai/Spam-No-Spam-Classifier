# Spam-No-Spam-Classifier
This model is based on polynomial Naive Bayes classifier that was computed from vectorized data produced from two different approaches.

In the first approach we vectorize the bag of words generated, using Count Vectorizer.

In the second approach we vectorize the bag of words generated, using TF-IDF Vectorizer.
